## Situation
<!-- Description of the current situation -->
After the 1960 coup, the Republic of Congo split into two nations: The Republic of Congo and Katanga. Led by Moise Tshombe, Katanga represented Belgian mining interests in the region as well as the interests of Katanga. The Republic of Congo sought UN intervention to reunify the country leading to the formation of ONUC (United Nations Operation in the Congo). In response to this Thsombe allowed ""Ex"" Belgian Officers to serve in key positions of the Katangese Grendarmerie and later hired in mercenaries to strengthen his own military force. Ever since then, the Katangese Grendarmerie has been working to suppress rebels of a Congolese aligned political party called BALUBAKAT (Association Générale des Baluba du Katanga). Now, with the BALUBAKAT rebels nearly defeated, this last operation will serve to completly eliminate their presence from katanga bringing peace to the region. However the last few weeks the UN has sent in peacekeepers, significantly impeding ongoing operations and becoming a major hindrance. There are also talks of a the UN passing a new resolution which aims to remove foreign personnel, including mercenaries, from the katangese army. This is a clear attempt by the UN to weaken Katanga's military footprint to facilitate a Congolese takeover.

/* MISSION */
"
<!-- Who, What, Where, When, and Why? -->
## Description
Operation Katanga Unity is a mission aimed at supporting katangese grendarmerie in their efforts to arrest BALUBAKAT rebels who have occupied a radio station in Sikobokobo. The primary objective of this operation is to restore peace and stability in the region.

## Situation Overview
Sikobokobo, located in the Katanga region, has been facing unrest due to the presence of Balubakat rebels who have occupied the radio station, using it as a base to spread their propaganda and coordinate their activities. This has not only disrupted vital communication channels but also endangered the lives of innocent civilians residing in the vicinity.

## Objectives
1. **Neutralize Rebel Threat:** The immediate focus is to neutralize the BALUBAKAT rebels who have taken control of the radio station.

2. **Support Katangese Forces:** Our primary role is to provide support to the katangese grendarmerie who are leading the ground operation. This will involve coordinating closely with their command to provide intelligence, reconnaissance, and logistical assistance, ensuring they have the necessary resources to effectively carry out the arrest operation.

3. **Secure the radio station:** Once the rebels have been neutralized, the next objective is to secure the radio station and ensure its free from any other threats.

## Commander's Intent
### Center of Gravity
<!-- Identification of the enemy's strongest characteristic or capability -->
The BALUBAKAT is only held together by the frail promises of it's leader; Jason Sendwe.

### Critical Vulnerability
<!-- Identification of the enemy's most critical vulnerability -->
They are quick to surrender under threat of violence as most of it's members are easily convertible poor people who aren't likely to give their lives for the cause.

### Desired Endstate
<!-- Description of the desired end state for a completed operation -->
The desired end-state is for the radio station operated by BALUBAKAT rebels to be shut down to stop their recruitement efforts, and all operators of the radio station to be imprisoned.

## Concept of Operations
<!-- Special execution instructions -->
Link up with the Katangese Grendarmerie forces at SA (Staging Area) Kimba, from here support them in their endeavour to take the radio station and in seizing BALUBAKAT rebels on the premises.
The Katangese has operational control meaning you are at the whim of their commander.
